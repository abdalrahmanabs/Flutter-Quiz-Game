# Quiz Game App

This is a simple quiz game application developed using the Flutter framework. The app presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, allowing them to test their knowledge on various topics. The user's score is tracked throughout the game, and a final score is presented at the end of the game.

## Features

- Multiple-choice questions with two possible answers
- Score tracking for correct and incorrect answers
- Final score presentation with percentage of correct answers
- Alert box display when the user completes all the questions
- Cross-platform mobile application development using Flutter
- User interface designed using various Flutter widgets, including columns, rows, text buttons, and icons
- Code structured using stateful widgets to enable dynamic updates and interaction with the user interface

##  Add more questions 
To add more questions to the quiz game, you will need to make changes to the code in the quiz_Manager.dart file.

1-Open the quiz_Manager.dart file in your preferred code editor.
2-Locate the questions list variable, which contains the existing quiz questions and answers.
3-Add a new question to the list by creating a new Question object and appending it to the questions list. The Question object takes two arguments: the question text as a string and the correct answer as a bool (either true or false).
